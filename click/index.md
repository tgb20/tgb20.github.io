## About
This game was made in about 20 minutes to test uploading games to [Kongregate](https://www.kongregate.com). Not very creative or exciting, just a simple cookie clicker game, but without any gameplay. The picture above was the entire game.

My friend Mark from [Markbot](https://orange.haus/markbot) currently has the high score at 4,040. I would say go beat that but the dropbox link I used to host the game has gone away so it can't be played. You can still view the original game page [here](https://www.kongregate.com/games/tgb20/click) with the scores and comments.

The original caption was *"Click! A fun game with no point but to click more than your friends!"*
