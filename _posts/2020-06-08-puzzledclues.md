Puzzled Clues is a website built for the take home Puzzled Escape Games puzzle box.

#### About

This website was created to allow people working on the puzzle box to collect clues for solving their challenges in a secure way that limited thier clues. Puzzled can generate box codes that to send with the physical boxes. These codes give them access to a timer tracking how long they have taken, as well as a list of clues they can redeem. By default they have access to 3 clues, but can choose to take a time penalty to get more.

The full source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/tgb20/PuzzledClues)

Previously I had worked with Puzzled to program their Lost Wand room, building out emulated magic using Raspberry Pis and Arduinos.
