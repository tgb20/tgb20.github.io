#### About

In this Pokemon clone I was attempting to recreate a simple Pokemon game in Unity3D containing RTs RoosterMons. I got simple battles and tall grass to work, but lost motiviation to continue working on it as I started to need more art, and I am not good at pixel art. It also was taking a lot of time for a game that might not even be played by many people.

The original description was *"A pokemon clone I am creating to allow people to play as the Roosterteeth roostermons in an actual game. This is the first build and I hope to have it finished by the end of December."*
