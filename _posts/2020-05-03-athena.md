Athena is a Discord ticketing bot for running support on a Discord server

#### About

Athena is a simple Discord ticketing bot I made for running support in Discord servers. Right now it is not a state where it can be released publicly, but it does function well and provide people with the power to make tickets, set ticket topics, add people to tickets, and close tickets. My goals with it is to add a web dashboard to allow ticket history to be saved easier, and make it open so anyone can add it to their Discord server.
