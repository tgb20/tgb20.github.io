I made this project after watching the [HoloLens announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbhVCZKVOqE).

#### About
I used [Unity](https://unity3d.com) and the then Beta version of [Vuforia](https://vuforia.com).

I don't have a lot of information to say about this project. It was just a fun little experiment with building an AR app. It is also the first video I ever uploaded to YouTube.

One item of note is the phone I used for the AR demo, the [Sharp Aquos Crystal](https://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/Mobile/Models/AQUOSCRYSTAL-306SH.aspx). It has incredibly small bezels for the time and even now, besides the giant chin. It was well before the 2017 bezel-less craze. I think it made a great demo phone for AR as it removed the space between real life and the AR world.

The planet used in this demo inspired my next 2015 project, [Planet Explor](https://orange.haus/planetexplor).

Since then I have made a few AR apps, but none of which I have saved/uploaded in any form.

The original description was *"This is a demonstration of my augmented reality project. It was inspired by Microsoft HoloLens. I am going to continue updating it until it's to a state I like. It looks amazing in person."*
