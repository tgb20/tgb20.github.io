This was an idea for a game I had where you would solve puzzles on a series of spherical planets.

#### About
The video demonstrates one of the first puzzles, in which you have to grow an apple tree, but the seed spawning bugged out.

This idea never really went anywhere, but I knew the main character would be a pig.

The original caption was *"I recently found a bug in the game I am currently making and I thought I might share it."*
