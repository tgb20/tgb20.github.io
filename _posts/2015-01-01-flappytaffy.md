I made this game using [Unity](https://unity3d.com) for some friends in my homeschool group.

#### About
I eventually released it on the Play Store but took it down after a year or so. You could play Flappy Bird as members of the group and it was just meant as a fun game for them.

You can download the APK file for the app [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17krTXW_QsiZfqCkKP1CsOCLbdtfuNGB9/view?usp=sharing).

The original caption was *"This is a fun little game I made for my local homeschool group. You play as 16 of the people as they navigate through series of random pipes."*
