#### About

Swift is my favorite language to program in and when I got the opportunity to make a class for Holyoke Codes I was quite excitied. This is an adapted tutorial I found online to make it more teachable. With the introduction of SwiftUI and the recent acquisition of several more Macs I plan to make a new guide using SwiftUI.
