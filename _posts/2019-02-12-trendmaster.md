Comparing Apples and Oranges with Alexa.


#### About
Amazon used to host nearly month hackathons for building Alexa skills when they were first launching the system and I always wanted to join one, but either forgot, ran out of time, or just couldn't think of anything.

The January 2019 hackathon came around and I thought I should actually try and make something. This is when I made Trend Master, a skill that can compare two items with Google Trends and tells you who won. This is based off a game show on Youtube I watch with the same name.

I mainly entered because the participation award was a Echo Dot Gen 3 and a Firestick 4K.

You can add the skill to Alexa [here](https://www.amazon.com/Orange-Haus-Trend-Master/dp/B07NPHJVQ9/).
