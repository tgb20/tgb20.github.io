I recently learned about the Microsoft Dreamspark program, and the Indie Dev tools for the Xbox 360.

#### About
With Dreamspark you get access to a lot of Microsofts professional development software, including the libraries required for build an Xbox 360 game. Shortly after getting the software I made this quick demo, but I later found the access they provide to be quite slow and not that usful so I did not develop for the 360 any more.
