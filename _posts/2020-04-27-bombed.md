The 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash

#### About

This is a ArcGIS story map I created about the 1961 B-52 crash.

On January 23rd 1961 a Boeing B-52G took off from Seymour Air Force Base in Goldsboro, NC carrying two 3.8 megaton atomic bombs for a air training mission. This plane fell apart in the air and due to a series of malfunctions the bombs did not go off.

I made this interactive story map to learn about story maps and also write a bit about my favorite air disaster.
