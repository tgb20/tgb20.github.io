With a small group of students I worked on building a robotic mini golf course for the Holyoke Public library.

#### About
The main hole I worked on was a large jaw that opened and closed by raising your hands into the air. This was accomplished with a Xbox Kinect sensor reading the arm position of all the players putting. When their hands went about their head it sent a message through the socket server to open up the jaws and let the players ball reach the hole.

The jaws were designed in Fusion 360 and plasma cut to bend into the shape, with room for an axle to rotate to allow the jaw to open and close.

The second hole consisted of a ramp leading up to two spinning platforms you had to get your ball across by timing when they would line up.
