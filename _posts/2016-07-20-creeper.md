A tutorial I made for making a crepper in TinkerCAD to be 3D printed.

#### About

This was my first class I taught at Holyoke Codes. I showed off a basic use of TinkerCAD to create 3D models. We have continued to use TinkerCAD for many more projects and its still an excellent tool. This tutorial was featured on the TinkerCAD twitter account when it was first published.

The original description was *"Whenever you see a yellow flash I used CTRL + D or CMD + D to make a copy of  an object. How to make a creeper in TinkerCAD. Designed for Holyoke Codes but available to anyone"*
