## About
I created Markbot in 2014 as my friend Mark was leaving for college. Nearly every month we would either play board games or have movie marathons. This was going to be an issue when he left for college.

The core mechanics of Markbot were built from and [NXT LEGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT) set. The base was a modified rubics cube solver I had built previously that month. This is the solver I built: [Mindcubr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dreTvumjNyw).

On the software side I had a skype call running on my iPhone 5, though I am not sure how I recorded this video as it was the only camera I owned. The NXT robot was being remotely controlled by an app I wrote with [AI2](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/). Unfortunatly I do not have the account I used to create this app anymore and cannot recover the code. The android tablet I was using, an [original Nexus 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_(2012)), was remotely controlled through my computer. On my computer I was running [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/), which allowed Mark to remotely control my computer, and by proxy the tablet.

This entirely system worked pretty smoothly and I was happy with the results. Looking back on it now I know how complicated I made everything and if I rebuilt it today, which I am considering as a future project, I could make the entire system much simplier and remove the computer from the equation entirely, allowing for peer-to-peer control of the robot.
