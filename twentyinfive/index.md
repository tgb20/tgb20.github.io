## About
This is a simulation I made in Maya for a class at UMass Amherst in high school. Despite what it claims, its not accurate in anyway and has some typos. I would take it down but am leaving it up solely for archival purposes.

The original description was *"This is a video of the position of the planets for the next 20 years. Their distances from each other and their sizes is not accurate. Only their rotational position around the sun is accurate. Thanks for watching and subscribe for more."*
