## About
SolarCalc is an app that helps you size your grid tied solar array to offset any portion (or all!) of your electric bill.  Find out how much you can expect to pay when GridFree! NC manages your installation, and find out how much you may save with government incentives!  Easy to use and understand.

Using a database provided by the owner of the company I built a small search engine to compare your location with their rates. It was designed for their employees and potential customers to use.

This app was taken down something in late 2018, early 2019 for not updating to new Play Store standards. The company it was built for no longer exists, so its not anything I plan on bringing back.
