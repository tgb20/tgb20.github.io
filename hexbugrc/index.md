## About
This RC car was made by using a hex bug, some hot glue, and LEGO pieces.

While this car was limited in its capabilities, mainly it could only go forward and backwards, it is the earliest maker project I have record of. It was later rebuilt at my grandmother's house to use a propeller to move at a much faster rate on a matchbox car style body. Unfortunately, there is no record of this.

I have spent awhile trying to find the exact hex bug I used, and it doesn't seem to exist. It had two legs, one on each side and could work its way around using a remote control.

The original caption was *"How to build a remote-control car: rip apart a hex bug and legos here and there and tada!!!!!!! you have to figure out the rest"*
