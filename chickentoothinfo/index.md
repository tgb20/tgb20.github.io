## FAQ

### Why FIRST only?

Chicken Tooth is designed to improve the Rooster Teeth iPad experience and I do not wish to take revenue from Rooster Teeth. I cannot serve their ads, so I require every user of Chicken Tooth to have a paying FIRST membership.

### How do I request a feature?

You can join our discord [here](https://discord.gg/WV69dGw). This is where all news and updates are posted and requests/bugs are processed. If you submit them any other way I cannot guarantee support. DO NOT contact Rooster Teeth with bugs/requests, this app is maintained solely by myself.

### Its been a while since I last got an update for the app.

There is only one developer of Chicken Tooth, and I am not looking to take on any new developers. I also work part time and I am a full time college student. This puts strain on my schedule. My goal is to have one minor update every 2 weeks, and at least 1 major update every month, but depending on my schedule this might not be possible.
