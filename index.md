# Welcome to Orange Haus
This site serves to document and show various projects I have built over my time as a developer.

Projects with an * means that source code for the project has been lost to time, and only video or photographs exist. I have done my best to describe these projects.

*The following projects are sorted by year, and roughly by month, with closer to the top being newer*
