# Welcome to Orange Haus
This site serves to document and show my various projects I have built over my time as a developer. It is important to note that some projects are "lost" and only remnants remain. I have tried to document everything I remember, but often things are lost over time. Projects are sorted by year, and if complete/dead then date in which I stopped working on them.
