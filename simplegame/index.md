# Simple Game

## About
This is the project I have the least information about, but I am including it here because of its importance to myself. 

This was the first game I ever made, it was the first time I ever shared a project I made with someone, and it was the first time I used a development enviroment that wasn't notepad .bat files.

I made Simple Game (it's actual title) using [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/construct2) on the car ride home from somewhere. Simple game consisted of a single green cube with eyes and a mouth made from rectangles that could hop around the screen using some button prompts on the bottom of the screen. There was a floor and some walls to keep the player from leaving the screen, but that was it.

I use Simple Game as my hello world for every new game engine I learn. I used it for [Unity](https://unity3d.com), [Love2D](https://love2d.org), [SpriteKit](https://developer.apple.com/spritekit/), and several others. This game holds a special place in my heart. I even recreated it a few years later with two players and socket based multiplayer when I was learning how to use sockets.

Unfortunatly beyond this web page there is no record the original game exists. I made it with my original laptop, which I recieved Christmas 2012 with a copy of [SimCity Societies](https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/simcity/simcity-societies) and [Civilization IV](http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/). I sold this laptop a few years later and wiped the harddrive with it. That laptop and this game mark the start of my love for programming and games.
