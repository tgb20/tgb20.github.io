## About
Using an Arduino, Floppy Disk Drive, and an old computer power supply I created a system that allows the playback of music on a single floppy drive.

This was inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxlXT0z_HNE) video.

I used the original Moppy to drive the drive. You can find an updated version [here](https://github.com/SammyIAm/Moppy2).
