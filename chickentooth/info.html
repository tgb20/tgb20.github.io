    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Why do I need a FIRST account?</h3>
            <p>Because I am streaming content from the Rooster Teeth website I have no way of serving their ads that are not baked into their website. Therefore to make sure I am not providing a bypass to Rooster Teeth ads I require FIRST membership.</p>
