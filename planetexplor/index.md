## About
This game/educational tool was created using [Unity](https://unity3d.com) and [NASA 3D Resources](https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/). I was inspired to make this after making the [AR demo](https://orange.haus/augmentedrealitydemo) in which I used a planet model. This was going to be the first game I would ever "sell" but never actually setup any store for it because the polish on the game was not to a high enough quality.

The original description was *"This is a trailer for my new program Planet Explor. Planet Explor lets you explore the solar system and find new information about our planets. This program is designed to teach people new and interesting things about our solar system. Available on Mac, Windows, and Linux"*
