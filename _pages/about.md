<p>This website serves as a log of any and all (when I remember) projects I have worked on. My goal is to have this website contain as much detail as possible, allowing for these projects to be revisited and used for reference in the future. As of now I am finishing my senior year of college at UMass Amherst studing CS Informatics. My goal is to find a job at a place where I feel challenged and I contribute to the world. Whether this is through teaching, building software for better energy, or just working on good projects, I look forward to what will come next. If you would like to check me out on other platforms you can check me out below!</p>
